                While freelancing as a translator and editor I had the
                opportunity to work on my own website, and a colleagues. This
                was so inspiring that I kept thinking about it ever since.

                This year I decided to take the plunge and start a new
                adventure. In February I enrolled in a full-stack development
                course at Winc Academy (remote learning). So far I have gained
                knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, React,
                Redux, Jest, Git, Github and NodeJS.

                At present I'm busy with the final front-end assignment: a
                react-app showing ratings in a chart (student-dashboard). When
                finished, I will proceed with the back-end development course,
                which will cover Python, Flask and SQL.

                What I love about programming is that it allows for creativity
                and logical thinking, at the same time, both of which I love. It
                would be great to gain experience and broaden my front-end
                knowledge in a junior developer job, while in the spare time
                finishing the back-end course.
              </Paragraph>

                So, if you are looking for an enthusiastic beginner programmer
                with a creative background (academy of arts), who loves to learn
                and would bring a problem solving attitude to your team, please
                feel free to get in touch.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>Hope to hear from you soon!</Paragraph> */
